You should have already filled out the Google Form to join the team. Within 48 hours of filling out the form, you will receive an email with your login information to the development server.

***

### **To log onto the server**, follow these instructions:
If you are on MacOS or Ubuntu:
- For MacOS, install XQuartz: https://www.xquartz.org/.
- Open a terminal window and type: `ssh -XC your_username@dev.purduerm.org -p 34229`. 
- Enter your password (from email) and you will be placed into your home directory. If you are asked to accept/deny a key, accept it. 
- Your starter code for onboarding is waiting for you!

If you are on Windows:
- Install X410 server from https://www.x410.dev (free version).
- Install PuTTY from https://www.putty.org.
- Open PuTTY. Under the "Connection" > "SSH" > "X11" settings, make sure the `Enable X11 forwarding` option is checked. Set `localhost:0.0` as the "X display location".
For your login information:
	- Hostname: `dev.purduerm.org`
	- Port: `34229`
- In the save/load box **save this profile with a name**. Every time you want to log in, you will load this profile.
- Hit connect, and for Username/Password see your email. You will be placed into your home directory! If you are asked to accept/deny a key, accept it.
- *NOTE: You need to start X410 server manually. If displaying images doesn't work during your project, this is likely why!*
